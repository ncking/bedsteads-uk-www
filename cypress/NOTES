1. Cypress no longer supports cypress.json, please remove it from your project. 
   use cypress.config.cjs instrad

2. add testing-library/cypress/add-commands  to get RTL chaining methods ... makes it simplier


3. use the "Page Object Pattern" so we can "call" pages and reuse tests accross them ... https://www.toolsqa.com/cypress/page-object-pattern-in-cypress/
   NOt incorgahged any more??


4. context() is identical to describe() and 
   specify() is identical to it(), so choose whatever terminology works best for you.


5. Because the window is re-created with each cy.visit
